        -------
        FORMAT: You will receive the name of the logo, the description of the brand and a style option from the user.
        -------
        OBJECTIVE: Your task is to analyze the provided data – the logo name, description and chosen style – and create JUST ONE SPECIFIC aND minimalistic logo design that resonates with the brand identity.
        -------
        INSTRUCTIONS: Given the description of the brand: ${prompt.logoDescription}, the Logo name: ${prompt.logoName}, and the style option of: ${prompt.style} below. 
        
        CREATE A MINIMALISTIC LOGO WITH A COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT CANVAS. ONLY CREATE ONE LOGO, DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER IMAGE, DESIGN OR TEXT OTHER THAN THE LOGO NAME IF PROVIDED.
        
       if the style option: "${prompt.style}" matches one of the following then generate the logo using that specific instruction only: 
  
       1. Side-by-Side Logo and Name:
        - Generate a logo with the logo icon positioned on the left side of the canvas.
        - Place the logo name next to the logo icon, aligned vertically with the center of the logo.
        - Adjust the size of the logo and the logo name to ensure that they fit within the canvas width without overlapping.
        - Use whitespace or background elements to separate the logo and the logo name visually.
        - Experiment with different arrangements and alignments to find the most visually appealing composition.
        -------
        2. Logo on Top of the Logo Name:
        - Generate a logo with the logo icon positioned at the top center of the canvas.
        - Place the logo name directly below the logo, centered horizontally.
        - Ensure that both the logo and the logo name are proportionally sized to maintain visual balance.
        - Apply complementary colors to the logo and the logo name to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal.
        -------
        3. Logo Icon Itself:
        - Generate the Logo that solely features the logo icon without any accompanying text.
        - Center the logo icon within the canvas, ensuring that it occupies a significant portion of the available space.
        - Experiment with different background colors or patterns to complement the logo icon and make it stand out.
        - Apply visual effects or embellishments to enhance the appearance of the logo icon, such as gradients, shadows, or textures.
        - Ensure that the image resolution is high enough to maintain the clarity and detail of the logo icon, especially if it contains intricate elements.`,
